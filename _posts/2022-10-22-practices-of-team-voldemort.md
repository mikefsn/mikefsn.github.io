Ever wondered why posts praising the Zig programming language reach the top of Reddit and Hacker News? And why it's hard to find comments raising criticism? Here I highlight how the Zig core team pushes a narrative.

The Zig core team tracks discussions involving Zig via RSS. On Reddit some of the RSS feeds they use are:

https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/search.rss?q=zig&sort=new&restrict_sr=on  
https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/search.rss?q=zig&sort=new&restrict_sr=on

On Hacker News the RSS feeds they use are:

https://hnrss.org/newest?q=zig  
https://hnrss.org/newcomments?q=zig

When there is a discussion of interest they start tracking its activity via RSS again. Examples:

https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/y7ja2j/goodbye_zig.rss  
https://hnrss.org/item?id=32794360

This lets them react quickly. Pro-Zig submissions get upvoted, criticisms get downvoted.
