title: "How the Zig core team pushes a narrative"
---

The Zig team tracks discussions about Zig via RSS. Example feeds they use on Reddit:

- [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/new.rss](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/new.rss)
- [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments.rss](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments.rss)

On Hacker News the RSS feeds they use are:

- [https://hnrss.org/newest](https://hnrss.org/newest)
- [https://hnrss.org/newcomments](https://hnrss.org/newcomments)

This lets them brigade discussions and push a narrative (e.g. "Zig is faster than C", "Zig is more memory-safe than Rust"):

- [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33103267](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33103267)

This also lets them censor opinions they disagree with:

- [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/y7ja2j/goodbye_zig/](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/y7ja2j/goodbye_zig/)

Not only do they use RSS to push a narrative, they also use it to stalk and harass users. RSS feeds of my accounts:

- [https://www.reddit.com/user/mikefsn.rss](https://www.reddit.com/user/mikefsn.rss)
- [https://hnrss.org/user?id=mikefsn](https://hnrss.org/user?id=mikefsn)

Unfortunately since the RSS feeds are public, I'm afraid they're going to keep abusing them.
